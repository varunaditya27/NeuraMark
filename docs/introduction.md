# Introduction to NeuraMark

Welcome to the official documentation for NeuraMark, a pioneering platform that leverages blockchain technology to establish immutable proof-of-authorship for AI-generated content.

## The Problem

In the age of advanced generative AI, distinguishing between human-created and AI-generated content has become increasingly difficult. Moreover, proving the origin of a specific piece of AI-generated work—who created it, with what prompt, and at what time—is a significant challenge. This ambiguity can lead to issues with intellectual property, plagiarism, and content authenticity.

## The Solution

NeuraMark addresses these challenges by providing a decentralized, transparent, and verifiable system for registering and verifying AI-generated content. By creating a cryptographic link between a creator, their prompts, and the resulting AI output, NeuraMark establishes a permanent, tamper-proof record on the blockchain.

This documentation will guide you through the features, architecture, and usage of the NeuraMark platform. Whether you are a user looking to protect your AI-generated creations or a developer interested in contributing to the project, you will find the information you need to get started.
