# AI Originality Score

NeuraMark incorporates a sophisticated AI-powered originality scoring system to provide users with insights into the uniqueness of their registered content.

## Gemini AI Integration

The originality score is generated by Google's Gemini AI, which analyzes the content of a new proof and compares it against a database of existing proofs.

### How It Works

1.  **Content Analysis**: When a new proof is registered, its content (both prompt and output) is sent to the Gemini AI for analysis.
2.  **Comparison**: The AI compares the new content with existing proofs in the NeuraMark database to identify similarities.
3.  **Score Generation**: Based on its analysis, the AI generates an originality score from 0-100%, along with a detailed report.

### Score Interpretation

The originality score is color-coded for easy interpretation:

-   ðŸŸ¢ **90%+**: Highly Original
-   ðŸŸ¡ **40-89%**: Moderately Original
-   ðŸ”´ **<40%**: Low Originality

The analysis also includes a confidence level and a list of any similar proofs that were detected.

## Non-Blocking Registration

The AI originality analysis is a non-blocking part of the proof registration process. This means that a proof will be successfully registered on the blockchain regardless of its originality score or the availability of the AI service. The originality score is provided as a supplementary tool to help users understand the uniqueness of their content.
